\section{Singular Homology Theory}
Here we will introduce the singular homology theory of an arbitrary topological space. The ultimate goal is the \person{Mayer}-\person{Vietoris} sequence and a few applications like \person{Brouwer}-Theorem and nonretractibility of a disk onto its boundary.
So lets start with a few definitions
\begin{definition}
	We are in $\Rn$ and $x,y \Rn$ are points. Lets define a few things
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \begriff{segment}
		\item \begriff{convex}
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
\todo[inline]{Okay thats worth a proof!}
\begin{*remark}
	Thats crucial here, but need to show that $\bigcap$ of all convex sets in $\Rn$ which contain $A$ are again convex.
\end{*remark}
